# ðŸª‘ type description reference
type can be used primarily for the following applications
- Pre-transmission validation
- Data validation with some sen editor
  - Verification rules used in the UI implemented in browsers and other devices
- Interface Description
- scaffolding

## âœ” type define operator ":@ <"
```sen
:@Book<
```
The definition of type begins with ":@" and ends with "<".  
with name-fixing operator "$"  
```sen
:@$Book<
```
In addition, the beginning ":" is a meta-description operator.

### â—† property additions operator ">"
```sen
:@Book
  >title
<
```
with name-fixing operator "$"  
```sen
:@$Book
  >$title
<
```

#### â—† type designation operator "@"
```sen
:@Book
  >title @string
<
```
You can specify the type of the property by specifying a type token.  
// TODO type token  
// TODO type-determining expression  

### â—† doc-comment operator "!"
Doc comment Operator "!" to write a comment is available.  
It is possible to write a value literal afterwards.
