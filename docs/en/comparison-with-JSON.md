# ðŸ‘€ Comparison with JSON
Let's get acquainted with sen's notation in comparison to JSON, a popular notation.
## Basic usage
To represent a simple single object in a text file, it is written as follows.

```JSON
ãƒ»JSON

{
  "title": "Rainbow Fish",
  "code": "978-3-3140-1544-1",
  "genre": "Children's book",
  "issueDate": "1992-01-27",
  "author": {
    "name": "Marcus Pfister",
    "birthdate": "1960-07-30"
  },
  "dailySales": 2,
  "isOutOfPrint": false
}
```
```sen
ãƒ»sen

>title : "Rainbow Fish"
>code : "978-3-3140-1544-1"
>genre : "Children's book"
>issueDate : 1992-01-27
>author :
  >name : "Marcus Pfister"
  >birthdate : 1960-07-30
<
>dailySales : 2
>isOutOfPrint : false
```
They are similar but not the same. Let's check out what's going on, one by one.
### Flat
It's not a big deal, but sen doesn't require a root object like Json.  
If you need a root object, write the following.
```sen
>:
  >title : "Rainbow Fish"
  >code : "978-3-3140-1544-1"
  >genre : "Children's book"
  >issueDate : 1992-01-27
  >author :
    >name : "Marcus Pfister"
    >birthdate : 1960-07-30
  <
  >dailySales : 2
  >isOutOfPrint : false
<
```
### String
String in sen (sen-string) is simple and straightforward.  
- Surrounded by double or back quotations.  
- Quotation marks escape by layering them on top of each other.  

Sen-string can contain all possible characters without escaping.  
```sen
>title : "Rainbow Fish"
>code : "978-3-3140-1544-1"
>remarks: "This book is a hot seller.
Please stack it as flat as possible."
>sellingPhrase: `Enjoy the beautiful foil stamping and, more importantly, the "beautiful story".`
```
Hence, each application layer may require its own sanitization.  
The basic encoding is UTF8. There is a way to describe the encoding hints is provided.  
### Property name is not a string
For example, the following property names are allowed in JSON.  
```JSON
{
  "number": 1,
  "text": "string",
  "bool": true,
  "null": null,
  "": 1,
  " ": 1,
  "foo bar": 1,
  "1": 1,
  "-1": -1,
  "\n": 1,
  "\t": 1,
  "\\": 1,
  "/foo": 1,
  "\u0001": 1
}
```
This is because JSON objects are key-value, not structures.  
Key-value is easy to understand, but it's unwieldy from programs that need the type.  
(Strictly speaking, JSON is not a pure key-value because it allows for key duplication.)  
In sen, the only available symbol for a property name is the underscore. (Only the underscore is an error.)  
Property names must be written in alphanumeric form only and must not contain spaces or begin with a number.  
### Comment
You can't write comments in JSON, in sen's case it looks like this.
```sen
//"this is a comment."
>title : "Rainbow Fish"//"this is a comment."

//"this
 is 
 a 
 comment."
>code : "978-3-3140-1544-1"
```
**//** represents the beginning of the comment, followed by the string.  
I don't recommend it, but you can put your comments anywhere except "in the string" and "just before the string".  

### Standard data type
// TODO: Write more about literal.
- string
- number  
(i8,i16,i32,i64,i128)  
(u8,u16,u32,u64,u128)  
(f32,f64,f128)  
- null
- array  
(array<T>)
- key<T>
- BNF based token
(date,datetime,time,dateoffset,datetimeoffset,timeoffset)  
(year,month,day of the month,and more...)  
- Sum type (enum)  
(bool,nullable,and more...)
### Schema
When we work with large amounts of data in a CSV-like way, we need data structures.  
[JSON (Hyper) Schema](https://json-schema.org/) allows you to define a type by writing JSON.  
I don't want to describe the json schema here, but in sen we describe the type definition as follows.  
```sen

```
